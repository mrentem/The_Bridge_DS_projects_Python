    "- Each function must be general. It must be useful for the most of cases.\n",
    "- Functions must not have repeated code. Each function must do something function.\n",
    "- The library should import others libraries as numpy, pandas, ...\n",
    "- The library must contain EDA functionality, no more. \n",
    "- The student can create more than one library at time. For example: a library that serves to do maths operation, another to show graphs, etc. In the next weeks, we will do more than one library. \n",
    "- Each function must be well documented. It must explain the functionality and each function param. \n",
